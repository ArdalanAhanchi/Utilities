Space remover is a simple bash script which traverses through all the files and directories 
in the current directory, and removes all the spaces from the files and replaces them with '_'.

To Run the Script:

	* Place the Space_Remover.sh file into the directory which you want to modify.
	  Please keep in mind that all the child directories will be renamed too.

	* Add Execution permissions to the file: chmod +X Space_Remover.sh

	* Execute: ./Space_Remover.sh
